    <h2>Peruvian Ceviche</h2>
    <p>
      Ceviche, which is often spelled ceviche or cebiche, depending on which
      part of South America it comes from, is basically raw fish and seafood
      marinated in citrus juice, mainly lime and lemon juice. The acid in the
      citrus juice coagulates the proteins in the fish, effectively cooking it,
      so it’s not heated, and it’s served cold or at room temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many different fish and shellfish can be used in preparing it. Snapper,
      sea bass, halibut, mah-mahi and tilapia are popular fish for making
      ceviche. Other seafood components can include shrimp, scallops, squid and
      octopus.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be eaten as a first course or main dish, depending on what is
      served with it. It seems as though there are as many varieties of ceviche
      as people who eat it.

        Place the potatoes and sweet potatoes in a saucepan and cover with
        water. Simmer until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, then
        drain, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Place the sliced onion
        in a bowl of warm water, let stand 10 minutes, then drain and set aside.

        Meanwhile, place the lime juice, celery, cilantro, and cumin into the
        bowl of a blender, and puree until smooth. Pour this mixture into a
        large glass bowl, and stir in the garlic and habanero pepper. Season
        with salt and pepper, then stir in the diced tilapia and shrimp.

        Set aside to marinate for an hour, stirring occasionally. The seafood is
        done once it turns firm and opaque.

        To serve, peel the potatoes and cut into slices. Stir the onions into
        the fish mixture. Line serving bowls with lettuce leaves. Spoon the
        ceviche with its juice into the bowls and garnish with slices of potato.
